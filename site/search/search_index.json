the repository but want to keep up with changes? Check out our gitter Hack channel . Have a quick question that doesn't require an issue report? Drop by our gitter Help channel and ask away. A typeface designed for source code Hack is designed to be a workhorse typeface for source code. It has deep roots in the free, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design make it legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8 - 14 range. The full set of changes to the upstream source are available in the changelog . The project is in active development, and we welcome your input and contributions. You may view our design objectives and instructions on how to contribute in CONTRIBUTING.md . Frequently asked questions are answered in our FAQ . Contents Features Quick installation Package manager installation Web font usage Additional tools for font customization Resources Contributing Build tools Acknowledgments License Specimen Overview of features Typeface Name : Hack Category : Monospaced Character set support : ASCII, Latin-1, Latin Extended A, Greek, Cyrillic Powerline Support : Yes, included by default Included Styles : Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic Quick installation NOTE ON FONT UPDATES If you are updating your version of Hack, be sure to remove the previously installed version and clear your font cache first to avoid conflicts that can lead to platform-specific rendering errors. Many platforms/distros offer package managers that automate this process. We release a Windows installer to automate the install/update process on the Windows platform. See below for additional details. Linux Download the latest version of Hack . Extract the files from the archive ( .zip ). Copy the font files to either your system font folder (often /usr/share/fonts/ ) or user font folder (often ~/.local/share/fonts/ or /usr/local/share/fonts ). Copy the font configuration file in config/fontconfig/ to either the system font configuration folder (often /etc/fonts/conf.d/ ) or the font user folder (often ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d ) Clear and regenerate your font cache and indexes with the following command: $ fc-cache -f -v You can confirm that the fonts are installed with the following command: $ fc-list | grep \"Hack\" Some Linux users may find that font rendering is improved on their distro with these instructions . macOS Download the latest version of Hack . Extract the files from the archive ( .zip ) and click to open them. Follow the instructions from your operating system. Enjoy! Windows The Hack Windows Installer simplifies installation on the Windows platform. The tool guides you through the installation process and addresses some common rendering issues that occur with font installs/updates on the Windows platform. This tool is the recommended installation approach for Windows users. Chrome/ChromeOS To use with Secure Shell , edit the following fields in Options: font-family: \"Hack\" user-css: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack.css Package managers We highly recommend the convenience of a community developed package manager or other auto-updating utility if this is available on your platform. While the package manager releases may be a bit delayed relative to the repository releases, the packages distributed through these package managers were designed to tune and automate font installs and updates on your system. We are aware of Hack support in the following package managers (with associated package names): Arch Linux : ttf-hack Chocolatey (Windows) : hackfont Debian : fonts-hack-ttf Fedora / CentOS : dnf-plugins-core :: heliocastro/hack-fonts :: hack-fonts Gentoo Linux : media-fonts/hack Homebrew Cask (OS X) : caskroom/fonts/font-hack Open BSD : fonts/hack-fonts OpenSUSE : hack-fonts Ubuntu : fonts-hack-ttf Visual Studio Package Manager : hack.font For installation issues with Hack packages, please contact the package maintainer directly. Web font usage Hack is available in the woff and woff2 web font formats. Bold and italic styles are included by default and work out-of-the-box via the <strong> and <em> tags. Hack is available through the jsDelivr and cdnjs CDN services: The following snippets provide examples of Hack web font use through the jsDelivr CDN. Adjust the URL paths to those provided by cdnjs (click the link above to find the appropriate URL) to switch to the cdnjs CDN. 1. Add Hack to HTML Include one of the following in the <head> section of your HTML file: Subset web fonts <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack-subset.css\"> Full character set web fonts <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack.css\"> 2. Add Hack to CSS pre, code { font-family: Hack, monospace; } See the WEBFONT_USAGE.md documentation for additional details, including instructions on how to download, host, and serve the web fonts on your web server. Additional tools for Hack font customization Customize your build with alternate glyph styles The alt-hack library includes a (growing) collection of alternate glyph styles that can be used to customize your Hack fonts. Don't like the default zero style? Swap out the UFO design source with a slashed zero or dotted zero and build new fonts that work better for you. We welcome contributions of new alternate glyph styles in the alt-hack repository. Design something new that works well with rest of the typeface and submit a pull request to the alt-hack repository so that others can use it in their custom builds. Detailed build instructions are available on the alt-hack repository README.md . Font renaming instructions to support side-by-side installs with upstream Hack are available below. Line spacing adjustments font-line is a tool that modifies the default line spacing used in the Hack design (20% UPM). The following gist installs font-line and modifies line spacing for all desktop font files contained in the same directory: linespace.sh ( download .zip ) Install modified and unmodified versions of Hack on the same system If you modify the upstream Hack source or the released font binaries and would like to install your modified fonts on the same system with the Hack fonts as released here, you can use the fontname.py Python script to define a new font name in the binary files. For example, you can install Hack on your platform along with a 15% UPM line spacing adjusted version as Hack Fifteen . Modify default glyphs with those in our alt-hack repository or design your own and define your creation with any name that you'd like. Following installation, your renamed fonts should show under the name that you define with the script so that you can switch between any of them as you need. Usage details and examples are provided on the fontname.py repository README. Resources Full specimen Changelog Project website Contributors Contributing We welcome contributions to Hack! Please review our CONTRIBUTING.md document for details. Built With Hack is built with the following free, open source projects: Font Bakery - post-compilation modifications fontmake - UFO to ttf compilation fontTools - OpenType table read/write font-v - font version string editor ink - stream editor for text file templating OpenFV - open specification for semantic typeface versioning sfnt2woff_zopfli - ttf to woff web font compilation ttfautohint - ttf instruction sets uni - Unicode code point search ufodiff - UFO source diffs ufoLib - UFO source file reads/writes/testing ufolint - UFO source file linting for CI testing woff2 - ttf to woff2 web font compilation Acknowledgments We would like to acknowledge and thank the jsDelivr and cdnjs teams for their support of the Hack project through their free web font CDN services. We greatly appreciate the tremendous support of open source software development by the Semaphore CI team. Their free CI testing service and rapid, excellent technical support have been tremendous assets for our project. Lastly, a huge thanks go out to all of those who do the unrecognized work to get Hack out there to users so that it is easy to access, install, upgrade, and use. There are redistribution package managers, review committee members, testers, and others across platforms/distros/applications who perform this thankless work and often go unrecognized. Your efforts are much appreciated. License Hack work is \u00a9 2018 Source Foundry Authors. MIT License Bitstream Vera Sans Mono \u00a9 2003 Bitstream, Inc.

This document outlines the core ideas on which we build to continually improve Hack. Ideally, they serve as a final rationale to decide disputes of whatever nature. Design is a highly subjective and opinionated topic. Being a collaborative effort, we prefer to focus on the discussion about a change, rather than the final product of a change. In practical terms this means that for any substantial amount of work, we'd like to see an Issue Report or Pull Request which presents an idea or the approach for a change. By keeping the discussion open, not only will you get community feedback, it also allows us to judge your contribution on more than the final product. Design Targets Hack is a general purpose typeface for source code. The needs of the many describe our core design targets. Generally, an issue that affects a majority of users receives higher priority than an issue that affects a minority of users. Core ASCII glyph set ; generally speaking, all source code is limited to the ASCII set. Content/comments/documentation, on the other hand, often includes non-ASCII characters. The former gets precedence over the latter. We focus on an accepted single glyph style for each glyph in the typeface sets. Glyph shape changes that are intended to address our design goals take precedence over changes that are purely subjective in nature. We offer the alt-hack repository for alternate Hack glyph styles and contributions of alternate styles are welcomed there. Font-sizes between 8-14 px , line-height >= 1 Cross-platform , cross font renderer support on Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems. Changes that address cross platform issues take precedence over issues that address platform specific issues. Changes that improve the typeface on some platforms but decrease its usability on others are generally not acceptable and belong in a fork that is intended for the platforms targeted for these changes. Usage in common source code display scenarios (on digital displays): text editors, terminals, embedded as web fonts, etc. Goals, areas of improvement Legibility - establish differences in the appearance of similar glyph shapes so as to properly identify different Unicode code points Readability - glyph shape and spacing optimizations to improve the capacity to read character-character, word-word, and code block-code block combinations in source code Visual semantics - establish semantic commonalities for glyphs used in source code text and create common visual designs within these semantic groups Issue Reporting Issue reports from users are extremely important to foster the ongoing development of the typeface. Before you report an issue, please confirm that you have installed the current version of the Hack typeface on your system. See the README.md page for details. If you identify a problem, we request that you report it through a new issue report on the Github repository. Please include the following information in your (bug) issue report: Font version (or timeframe when you downloaded the fonts if you do not know) Where you obtained the fonts (e.g. repository download, package manager, another source) variant(s) of the Hack fonts that are affected (Regular, Bold, Italic, BoldItalic) font size at which the problem was observed and whether it occurs at other sizes within the Core design target range (see above) operating system and version application where the issue was observed and version (important for us to understand the renderer involved) screenshot images that visually demonstrate the problem Please describe what led to the problem in detail. Pull Requests We highly encourage contributions to the Hack typeface source code, repository scripts, and documentation. To view areas where we currently need your help, check out the active issues Contribute! label . Please read and understand our design philosophy statement above in order to avoid frustration with work that we cannot merge upstream. We are willing to consider pull requests that follow these design guidelines. Having said that, there is never wasted work. If a change is of value to you, it is likely to be of value to others and this is the perfect situation for a downstream fork of Hack that you can maintain and share with other users. Pull requests for design changes Contributors who submit source modifications intended for merge into the Hack repository must license these changes according to LICENSE.md . If this is not acceptable, please do not submit your work for consideration. Contributors who modify the UFO source code should familiarize themselves with the UFO source specification. The Hack typeface currently uses version 2 of the UFO specification and documentation is available here . For pull requests that modify the design of the typeface, we request that you limit your source commits to the following changes unless we have discussed and explicitly requested additional file changes as part of the contribution. Glyph modifications Modifications include all existing glyph design changes, glyph additions, and glyph deletions. Only include the modified glyphs/*.glif source files for the modified glyphs in your pull request commits Modification of other source files is not acceptable and pull requests will not be accepted until the above condition is met You can achieve this design modification workflow with one of the following approaches: maintain a separate local directory for your design modifications and copy the glyphs/*.glif files that are changed to your local clone of the Hack source, then push to your remote repository fork for your pull request modify the Hack source in your local clone of the Hack repository and do not commit file changes other than those that are accepted in pull requests (i.e. only include *.ufo/glyphs/*.glif files in your commits) modify the Hack source in your local clone of the Hack repository, commit all files, replace all *plist files with the upstream versions then perform a git squash commit to eliminate the *.plist file changes in the git history (this approach can be used for those who didn't read the instructions and have already commited unacceptable file changes) Pull requests for script changes Contributors who submit script source modifications intended for merge into the Hack repository must license these changes according to the license specified in the script header for existing files. For new files, please discuss your license with us in an issue report before you submit your work for consideration. Please add an issue report that describes the issue that your pull request is intended to address (and that the pull request will close when merged). We request that you try not to add additional external dependencies to the project with your commits. This has the potential to prevent releases of Hack packages on some platforms. If you need to add a new dependency to the project, we suggest that you discuss this with us in advance through an issue report so that we can confirm that this is acceptable. Pull requests for documentation changes We love help with our docs! This includes anything from simple misspelling or grammar changes to major revisions of poorly written sections. For minor changes, a simple pull request suffices. For major edits, we recommend that you discuss the changes with us in an issue report before you go to the effort. Contributors Contributions to the project come in many forms and we want to broadly acknowledge those who spend time and effort to improve the project. We understand that many contributions to open source projects are not in the form of changes to the code base and therefore not automatically recognized in the Github repository UI. Use case specialists play an extremely important role in the improvement of this typeface. Individuals who have knowledge of the intricacies of open source typeface licensing, understand open source project redistribution processes, have the capacity to view errors and test in unique platform x font renderer situations, and many other areas that extend beyond the \"source code commit\" criterion have contributed their expertise to improve Hack. Understanding this issue, we maintain a CONTRIBUTORS.md list to acknowledge project contributors for their time and efforts under our own defintion of a project contribution. If you feel that you have helped to improve Hack and your contributions have been overlooked (i.e. you are not included on the contributors list), please let us know so that we can rectify this issue! In all likelihood this is an oversight and not intended to be a slight.","title":"Hack Typeface Design"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/CONTRIBUTING/#hack-typeface-design","text":"Hack is a monospaced typeface that is designed to optimize the display of source code text.

We understand that many contributions to open source projects are not in the form of changes to the code base and therefore not automatically recognized in the Github repository UI. Use case specialists play an extremely important role in the improvement of this typeface. Individuals who have knowledge of the intricacies of open source typeface licensing, understand open source project redistribution processes, have the capacity to view errors and test in unique platform x font renderer situations, and many other areas that extend beyond the \"source code commit\" criterion have contributed their expertise to improve Hack. Understanding this issue, we maintain a CONTRIBUTORS.md list to acknowledge project contributors for their time and efforts under our own defintion of a project contribution. If you feel that you have helped to improve Hack and your contributions have been overlooked (i.e. you are not included on the contributors list), please let us know so that we can rectify this issue! In all likelihood this is an oversight and not intended to be a slight.","title":"Contributors"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/FAQ/","text":"FAQ Contents Installation Bugs/errors License Contribute Modifications/Derivatives Tinkering Installation How do I download the current version of the Hack desktop fonts? You can find the current release of our desktop fonts in our releases list.

You can download the latest release of desktop and web fonts . We recommend that Windows users upgrade with the Windows installer as it addresses problematic font caching issues that take place on the Windows platform. Hack packages are also available through many package managers for those who would prefer to use this approach. Is there a web font CDN that I can use in my web pages? Yes. See the Web Font Usage section of the README.md document for details. How do I find the changes that occurred in recent releases? Please review the CHANGELOG.md document. Bugs/errors I found a problem with Hack, what do I do? Please search our issue reports and confirm that your problem has not already been reported or solved. If it appears to be a new issue, please review the issue reporting information in our CONTRIBUTING.md document and then file a new issue report with the necessary information to address your problem. How do I find my installed Hack version number? Please refer to documentation for your operating system to determine how to find the font version string for installed fonts. If you cannot find a solution, you can install and use our font-v tool to view the version string with the command font-v report [font path] . License How is Hack licensed? Hack is a derivative of upstream Bitstream Vera Sans Mono and DejaVu Sans Mono source. The Hack changes are licensed under the MIT license. Bitstream Vera Sans Mono is licensed under the Bitstream Vera license and maintains reserved font names \u201cBitstream\u201d and \u201cVera\u201d. The DejaVu changes to the Bitstream Vera source were committed to the public domain. You may view the full text of the license in LICENSE.md . Am I allowed to modify glyphs in Hack? Yes. Am I allowed to extend the character sets in Hack? Yes. Am I allowed to subset (decrease character set support) Hack? Yes. Am I allowed to create new build file types for Hack? Yes. Am I allowed to redistribute an unmodified version of Hack? Yes. Am I allowed to redistribute a modified version of Hack? Yes. Do I need to rename a modified version of \u201cHack\u201d? As of v3.000, the reserved font name \"Hack\" was removed from our license. You may use the name \"Hack\" for modified versions of the source, though we encourage you to change the name in a way that indicates how this differs from the upstream source if you intend to release the typeface to others. See the Modifications/Derviatives section of the FAQ below for more information. Do I need to provide attribution when I use Hack? No. Do I need to maintain the license with modified or unmodified software that is derived from the Hack source? Yes. Contribute Do you accept design contributions to Hack? Yes. Design contributions are welcomed and encouraged. Please review and familiarize yourself with the design guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md documentation before you begin work intended as a contribution to the upstream project. If you question whether the work is acceptable in the upstream, we ask that you file a new issue report to discuss it before you begin. Having said that, there is no wasted work and if your changes are not appropriate for the upstream source, a new downstream fork with changes that are important to you (and that you maintain) is very much encouraged. How are my design contributions to Hack licensed? Changes to the Hack source are licensed under the MIT license. Please confirm that this is acceptable to you before you submit contributions for design changes. We do not accept design contributions under a different license. I am not a professional typeface designer, can I contribute design changes to Hack? Absolutely. To our knowledge, no contributor who has committed design changes to Hack has a background in professional typeface design or formal typeface design training. We developed an itch that needed to be scratched, combed websites and books for information, viewed lots (and lots and lots more) of typefaces, installed font editors and learned how to use them, and then went to work. We continue to learn ourselves. You are simply at a bit earlier stage of the same journey. Dive in, learn, and let's see what you can come up with. Do you accept source/script contributions to Hack? Yes. Changes to current scripts are licensed under the MIT license. If you intend to submit new, non-UFO (i.e. typeface design) source and would like to license it in a different way, please file an issue report to discuss this before you perform the work. I have never contributed to an open source project. Does the Hack project support brand new open source contributors? Yes! Yes! Yes! We would love to have individuals who are brand new to the open source development community experience collaborative free, open source development for the first time through the Hack project. We were all there at one stage and had to get past the initial contribution jitters. Putting your work out in the open for the first time can be a daunting, vulnerable experience and there is a great deal to learn about how the open source contribution workflow works. Don't let this stop you because this could be the first step on a long path of participation in collaborative open source software development. We would love to kickstart the work of a new open source developer and intend to maintain a very receptive environment for new participants. Read the CONTRIBUTING.md document, then feel free to pitch ideas that you have as new issue reports on the repository. Let us know that you are new in town so that we can provide assistance where you might need it to get started. Can I submit ideas about design changes? Yes. Please understand our design priorities as defined in the CONTRIBUTING.md document and file your ideas as new issue reports. If you feel that the design priorities should be modified, feel free to submit a pull request with suggested changes or file a new issue report. We can discuss these modifications with either approach. How are my contributions to the Hack project recognized? Contributors are listed in the CONTRIBUTORS.md list. Who is considered a contributor to the Hack project? We attempt to broadly acknowledge contributions to the project as defined in the Contributors section of the CONTRIBUTING.md document. Please refer to that document for further details. Modifications/Derivatives I want to modify the Hack design and release it myself. Is this OK? Yes. I want to add character sets to Hack and release it myself. Is this OK? Yes. I want to decrease character set support in Hack and release it myself. Is this OK? Yes. I want to change Hack build file types and release it myself. Is this OK? Yes. I want to change the hinting approach used in Hack and release it myself. Is this OK? Yes. Do I need to provide attribution if I release my own project derived from Hack source? No. Do I need to modify the name of the typeface if I release a modified version? As of v3.000, the reserved font name \"Hack\" was removed from the license. It is no longer necessary to change the name for modified versions of the Hack source. Redistribution of modified source under the same name can be confusing to users and we would encourage you to modify the name in a way that clarifies your project goals relative to the upstream source if you intend to release the fonts to others. One approach is to add another term to the basename \"Hack\". For instance, a derivative that supports source code ligatures might be named \"Hack Ligature\" and a derivative that replaces the oval filled zero with a forward slash zero might be called \"Hack Slash\". Can I use Hack in the name of my own derived typeface (e.g. Hack Better)? Yes, this is highly encouraged if you modify the source and release it with the intent for others to use it. Can I change the name of a derived version and not use Hack in the name? Yes. If I make minor changes to the source and release this as my own project is this considered plagiarism? No. Absolutely not. This is well within the bounds of the license and you are welcome to do so. There are niche needs that some users have and our goal is to support these however minor through the development of derivative projects. We are attempting to make the build process, build tooling, and ability to pull any upstream source changes into your own downstream derivative as straightforward and simple as possible in order to support this. Also understand that you must maintain the upstream license in downstream derivatives. Tinkering Do you offer alternate styles of Hack glyphs that I can use to customize the fonts? Yes! The alt-hack stylistic alternate glyph library is available with *.glif files that contain new glyph designs for glyphs that exist in the Hack character sets. Copy the .glif file from the alt-hack library to the Hack source and overwrite the existing .glif file. Then rebuild the fonts with the instructions in docs/BUILD.md . How do I change the font name? The simplest approach is to open the UFO source code in a font editor and follow the instructions in the editor documentation, then re-save the UFO source to maintain the name changes (if you plan for repeat builds from source) and rebuild the font files. How do I modify the line spacing in Hack? We built the tool font-line to increase and decrease line spacing in Hack (and any other font). Please see the documentation in the font-line repository README for details. How do I modify the version string in a derivative that I create from the Hack source? You can approach this by either modifying the version in the UFO source or through the use of our font-v versioning tool. Please see the font-v repository for detailed usage instructions.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/FAQ/#contents","text":"Installation Bugs/errors License Contribute Modifications/Derivatives Tinkering","title":"Contents"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/FAQ/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"assets/cinder/css/hack-font/FAQ/#how-do-i-download-the-current-version-of-the-hack-desktop-fonts","text":"You can find the current release of our desktop fonts in our releases list.

You can either install the tools manually or use the automated build dependency installation approach documented below. Desktop font (ttf) build dependencies To build the Hack desktop fonts (ttf) from source you will need the following build dependencies: fontmake Python executable fonttools Python library ttfautohint executable (includes Harfbuzz and FreeType dependencies) Web font (woff + woff2) build dependencies To build the Hack web fonts from source you will need all of the build dependencies listed above for desktop font builds. In addition you will need the following dependencies for the web font build steps: sfnt2woff-zopfli C++ executable woff2_compress C++ executable Automated build dependency installation Install all build dependencies for desktop and web fonts with the following make command: $ make build-with-dependencies This will install all necessary build dependencies and complete a build of all desktop and web fonts. Automated font builds After the build dependencies are installed, use make targets from the root of the Hack repository to build font sets.
